# GP 2 Editor

This is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for the [GP 2 graph programming language](https://github.com/UoYCS-plasma/GP2). It allows GP 2 programs to be created, edited, and run from within one unified interface. The IDE was originally created by Ivaylo Hristakiev and Alex Elliott in 2015; the original implementation can be found in the [UoYCS repository](https://github.com/UoYCS-plasma/GP2-editor).

This project adds the ability to enable tracing for GP 2 programs, and then step through the generated tracefiles in a specially created user interface. This version of the IDE requires the [updated GP 2 compiler](https://github.com/jobbogamer/GP2) which adds the tracing functionality.

For building and usage instructions, see [the original README](https://github.com/UoYCS-plasma/GP2-editor/blob/master/README.md).
